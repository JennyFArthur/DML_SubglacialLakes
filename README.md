# DML_SubglacialLakes
**Active subglacial lake extents in coastal Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica** (Accompanying data for Arthur et al. (submitted, *The Cryosphere Discussions*). 

This repository contains a dataset of seven active subglacial lake boundaries detected from ICESat-2 and ICESat anomalies and the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA, *Howat et al., 2019*). Arthur et al. (submitted) provides full details of lake identification.

Lake naming convention follows the most proximal ice shelf:
L1 = Lazarevisen; V1 = Vigridisen; M1 and M2 = Muninisen; R1, R2 and R3 = Roi Baudouin.

Boundaries of Lakes L1, R1 and R2 have been delineated based on differencing of 2-m resolution REMA DEM strips, and boundaries of Lakes V1, M1, M2 and R3 have been manually delineated based on ICESat-2 elevation anomaly locations together with the REMA mosaic hillshade.

Dataset attributes: Lake area, distance from grounding line (MEaSUREs, *Rignot et al., 2016*), centre latitude, centre longitude, ice flow speed (*Gardner et al., 2018*), ice thickness (*Fretwell et al., 2013*; *Morlighem et al., 2022*) bed elevation (*Morlighem et al., 2022*), category (high-confidence/provisionally-active), dates of REMA DEM strips used to delineate lake boundary (where applicable).
