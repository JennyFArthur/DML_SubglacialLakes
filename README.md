# DML_SubglacialLakes
Active subglacial lake extents in coastal Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica (Accompanying data for Arthur et al. (submitted, THe Cryosphere Discussions). 

This repository contains a dataset of seven active subglacial lake boundaries detected from ICESat-2 and ICESat anomalies and the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA, Howat et al., 2019). Arthur et al. (submitted) provides full details of lake identification.

Lake naming convention follows the most proximal ice shelf:
L1 = Lazarevisen; V1 = Vigridisen; M1 and M2 = Muninisen; R1, R2 and R3 = Roi Baudouin.

Boundaries of Lakes L1, R1 and R2 have been delineated based on differencing of 2-m resolution REMA DEM strips, and boundaries of Lakes V1, M1, M2 and R3 have been manually delineated based on ICESat-2 elevation anomaly locations together with the REMA mosaic hillshade.
