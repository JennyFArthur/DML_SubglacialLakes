# Evidence of active subglacial lakes under a slowly moving coastal region of the Antarctic Ice Sheet
(Accompanying data for Arthur et al. (submitted, *The Cryosphere*). 

This repository contains:

(1) A GIS shapefile of seven active subglacial lake boundaries detected from ICESat-2 and ICESat anomalies and the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA, *Howat et al., 2019*). Arthur et al. (submitted) provides full details of lake identification methods.

(2) Matlab scripts for processing and plotting ICESat-2 ATL11 Level 3B version 6 land ice height data and ICESat GLAH12 version 34 land ice height data used in this paper.

Lake naming convention follows the most proximal ice shelf:
L1 = Lazarevisen; V1 = Vigridisen; M1 and M2 = Muninisen; R1, R2 and R3 = Roi Baudouin.

Boundaries of Lakes L1, R1 and R2 have been delineated based on differencing of 2-m resolution REMA DEM strips, and boundaries of Lakes V1, M1, M2 and R3 have been manually delineated based on ICESat-2 elevation anomaly locations together with the REMA mosaic hillshade.

GIS Shapefile attributes: 

**Lake area**, **distance from grounding line** (MEaSUREs, *Rignot et al., 2016*), centre **latitude**, centre **longitude**, **ice flow speed** (*Gardner et al., 2018*), **ice thickness** (*Fretwell et al., 2013*; *Morlighem et al., 2022*), **bed elevation** (*Morlighem et al., 2022*), **category** (high-confidence/provisionally-active), **dates of REMA DEM strips** used to delineate lake boundary (where applicable).
